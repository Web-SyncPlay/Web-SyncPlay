# Since the ".env" file is gitignored, you can use the ".env.example" file to
# build a new ".env" file when you clone the repo. Keep this file up-to-date
# when you add new variables to `.env`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any
# secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named
# ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional environment variables, the schema in "/src/env.js"
# should be updated accordingly.

# Example:
# SERVERVAR="foo"
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENTVAR="bar"

# To see if your .env file is working correctly,
# try running `docker-compose config`

# Modify if you pass your own running redis instance
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"

# The name of the site
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME="Web-SyncPlay"

# Your domain from which sessions are being served
# REMOVE trailing slash !!!
NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN="https://web-syncplay.de"

# Default URL to play when nothing is provided
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_SRC="https://youtu.be/NcBjx_eyvxc4"
